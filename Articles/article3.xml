  <Title>Thoughts Within the Void</Title>

    Airy:  Over what seemed like months, as if we could send our thoughts through a medium, DaDarkWizard and I communicated with each other.  We were able to bring our thoughts together and images formed in our mind.
    <br/><br/>
    DaDarkWizard: We need eyes before we can see, ears before we can hear. The ability to touch and feel before finding things to touch and feel.
    <br/><br/>
    Airy:  What would a grassland sound like?  Would there be danger?  I tried to be encouraging and keep things moving forward.  Things could only go up, or down, or somewhere else!
    <br/><br/>
    DaDarkWizard: Everything shall be a node, even the grass beneath our feet. Panes to hold their children, buttons to click, sprites to move around. It will be a structured creation.
    <br/><br/>
    Airy:  Nodes, Panes, Buttons, Sprites?  I didn’t understand what all this would mean or do, but if we could put all this together, we could get… someplace!  And reach these echoing thoughts through the bleakness.
    <br/><br/>
    It’sJohn: This is too much for me!!!
    <br/><br/>
    Joy: Sprites will appear when needed!
    <br/><br/>
    DaDarkWizard: Is this a premonition of what's to come? Or a simple faltering in the iron-wrought plans for the future? Only time shall tell. But no matter, I will forge on.
