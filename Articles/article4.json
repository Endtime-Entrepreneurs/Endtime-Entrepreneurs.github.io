  "Text":"<br/>DaDarkWizard: Striving for understanding, we began with the basics. Simple pictures, fleeting images cast into the void, hoping to find substance. Over and over we refined our process, honing our vision to the perfect edge we desired.<br/><br/>Airy: So, we developed our thoughts and ran it! Well, there was a lot of some kind of running anyway. Running is better than the emptiness of a void.<br/><br/>DaDarkWizard: In doing so, we surprised even ourselves. At first it was indeed as planned: everything was a node, plotted out with a universal structure. But with substance came true understanding and new cognizance. Escaping the nodes, our yet-unrefined bodies moved with efficiency.<br/><br/>Airy: It was great to get the grass under our feet. Someone had to test out a few fireballs...<br/><br/>DaDarkWizard: If flooding the wilderness with the wrath of Sol is your definition of a few â€“ but it was truly necessary, to understand our current limitations."
