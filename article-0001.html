            <h2><a>A few words from our team</a></h2>
            <p class="blog-text">
                <br>
                Hello world!  And Merry Christmas!
                <br><br>
                Airy the Dragon: We are a small group of game developers with big ideas.  For the last year we have been researching a new world!  A place where you can explore and discover new areas, build and create structures and items, battle and develop your character!  There are dangers… unknown creatures lurking about and strange forces that can change your character in unusual ways…  There is also a wizard…  There may be more to say about that later…
                We look forward to bringing you updates on our expeditions as we search for a place that is worthy of civilization!  Now for a brief introduction to our team:
                <br><br>
                I will start with myself, Airy!  I may not be the biggest dragon, but I can still make my presence known!  I love music, puzzles and having fun!  I am also using my organization skills and attention for details on this trip to see what we can discover on our journey!
                Now our other team members:
                <br><br>
                The Dark Wizard: Guess I'm next! Named for the seeming black magic I create at the keyboard, I'm using my abilities as a programmer to build the foundations of the world you stand upon. Through countless years of accumulated knowledge and study, I've stretched my influence to the far reaches of the continent. Known by many, yet seen by few, DaDarkWizard welcomes you!
                <br><br>
                John: Hi! I’m John!
                <br><br>
                Joy: After being tied to a desk, now I have my freedom.  I love art, using my imagination and running free.  Welcome to our world, where you control your destiny!
                <br><br>
